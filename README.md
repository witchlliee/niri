## About

This fork features basic support for screen tearing (along with some other niceties), and likely will exist until upstream does. So if you're a sweaty gamer, who can't put up with VSync latency - give it a try!
> [!WARNING]
> Implementation is not heavily tested, thus might be buggy. Feel free to leave feedback!

To get this running on your system, you will need to follow [build instructions](https://github.com/urayde/niri/blob/main/docs/wiki/Getting-Started.md#building).
For Arch-based distributions, you can install it via [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/niri-tearing-git).

To enable screen tearing, use a [debug option](https://github.com/urayde/niri/blob/main/docs/wiki/Configuration%3A-Debug-Options.md#force-tearing) or a [window rule](https://github.com/urayde/niri/blob/main/docs/wiki/Configuration%3A-Window-Rules.md#allow-tearing). Some applications (such as GE-Proton) can request tearing automatically.
